# Automated Data Analysis

This is a project which aims to automate the process for plotting graphs and creating ML models for a given csv. This is a college project.

## Appendix



In this project we have used SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder from [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) for our preprocessing of data. Additionally feature scaling has also been implemented using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler. Additionally all data has been imported from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and managed as a DataFrame using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
